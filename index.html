    Bear loves his favourite Marmalade sandwich when he is coding. Here is how you make it step-by-step:
    <ol>
        <li>Gather Ingredients: You will need two slices of bread and marmalade.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Workspace: Clear and clean your workspace, and have a plate ready to assemble your sandwich.</li>
        <li>Spread Marmalade: Take one slice of bread and spread a generous amount of marmalade on one side of it. Adjust the amount of marmalade to your taste preference.</li>
        <li>Top with Second Bread Slice: Place the second slice of bread on top of the marmalade spread to complete the sandwich.</li>
        <li>Optional Toasting: If you prefer your marmalade sandwich toasted, you can toast the bread slices in a toaster before spreading the marmalade. Alternatively, you can grill the sandwich in a sandwich maker after assembly.</li>
        <li>Serve: Place your marmalade sandwich on a plate. If not toasted, you might want to cut it in half or quarters for easier eating.</li>
        <li>Enjoy: Your simple marmalade sandwich is ready to eat. Enjoy it as a quick snack or breakfast treat.</li>
    </ol>
